title: What are you doing Microsoft?

Maybe I'm just the last one on earth to think of this, but MS effort around
its cloud platform scares me a lot.

Basically MS is doing what Google did in the past 15 years where it was working on
building a Google-centric web stack, all remote.
Since its birth, Google worked hard to propose everything, from protocols to
audio/video standards with the declared goal to build a better and faster
internet experience, I.E. QUIC now is the foundation of HTTP/3 standard. But
this huge task became something different when Chrome/Chroumium came out: this
was the foundamental piece for consumers and since then, Google has now a foot
in every device and the entire web experience is somewhat Google-dependant.

Coming back to Microsoft, the strategy is pretty clear to me: controlling the entire
developer stack, giving them best tooling, I admit, but pushing everyone toward Azure Cloud and, most importantly, keeping the source code online.
GitHub Actions along with the new Codespaces and testing suite Playwright can
make this possible.

It's no surprise that our devices are becoming just screen for something done in
the cloud, we'll eventually get used to this, but for now it keeps scaring me
loosing control over my source code.
